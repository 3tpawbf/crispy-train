one can consider this repository the property of the Apache License holder and not for free as it is fairly expensive and innovative research and development progress from an unemployed graduate student that is not enrolled in a university and does not want to agree to the contract associated with higher education given their understanding of the FAFSA breech they are independently suing the united states government over. these can be considered private, legal notes and I am to be afforded a team with which to work in order to describe my case and the main factors that should be considered for an amicable settlement as it relates to a minor crime against humanity case (sexualized labor, medical assault with forced consent). we have made it publicly available because we do not have an safety factor on our visibility in this space. as we have noted on our internal disk, this space should be considered a Swiss cyberspace, though those that you most wish to stop stealing will make themselves the most steadfast partner to simply theft something to save their asses from the sinking ship of the united states political machine. suffice to say, if you are a united states government employee you are ordered to identify yourself and at least pay my medical bills and a settlement for illegally spying on a civilian while running an office during my medical assaults.
