one can consider this repository the property of the Apache License holder and not for free as it is fairly expensive and innovative research and development progress from an unemployed graduate student that is not enrolled in a university and does not want to agree to the contract associated with higher education given their understanding of the FAFSA breech they are independently suing the united states government over. these can be considered private, legal notes and I am to be afforded a team with which to work in order to describe my case and the main factors that should be considered for an amicable settlement as it relates to a minor crime against humanity case (sexualized labor, medical assault with forced consent). we have made it publicly available because we do not have an safety factor on our visibility in this space. as we have noted on our internal disk, this space should be considered a Swiss cyberspace, though those that you most wish to stop stealing will make themselves the most steadfast partner to simply theft something to save their asses from the sinking ship of the united states political machine. suffice to say, if you are a united states government employee you are ordered to identify yourself and at least pay my medical bills and a settlement for illegally spying on a civilian's private notes while running a public office during multiple sexual and medical assaults of the parties involved.

# Carbon Offset Methodologies and Exploration

the following derivations will require you to ballpark your understanding of carbon, toxic waste, and energy offsets. we will attempt to give some frame of reference with real calculations and scaling with real numbers but the main point of these notes are to elucidate the vast differences between the mindsets of the political class and climate science deniers. if one dislikes climate science, perhaps one can consider this a fresh look at the understanding of how to utilize carbon offset methodologies to explain oneself transparently and live a that openly shares facts based on the Freedom of Information Act and not being afraid to assert legal dominance of someone to assume the role of a legal scholar without even training in a university setting or entering a courtroom to plead a case.

please consider the following assertion:
"cryptocurrency generation and maintence is bad for the environment"
one can dissect this by realizing first of all, it is not Accurate. it is a broad statement that doesn't give any frame of reference to how bad for the environment cryptocurrency generation and maintence actually is. we will argue that with a rational science background, one can make this statement much more fact based and give the reader a frame of reference to allow for them to scale the assertion in their mind and really be able to rationalize the statement along with the speaker.

now when one consider something to reference how negative it's effects are on the environment one must consider additionality. that is to say one must consider if the event one is referencing had never happened, would the world be better or worse. a simpler example than crypto emissions would be to consider the following. if ted bought a gun a year ago and then 3 years later they witnessed a crime and shot and killed the criminal, the additionality of this example could examine whether ted should have bought the gun or not bought the gun. one side could say if ted hadn't bought the gun, the criminal would have lived. but one could also argue, even when ted bought the gun, the criminal was still able to commit the crime, even though ted killed them. and finally if ted had not bought the gun, one could not be sure whether the crime would have been commited at all. the criminal's life would not be assured other than one knowing that if the criminal was shot and killed and ted had not bought the gun, ted would not be responsible for the criminal's death.

now that one can rationalize additionality, consider the following derivation. cryptocurrency generation, processesing and maintence is a computer intensive practice. it takes large sized hardware (on the order of giga and terabytes) to run continuously and compute complex algorithms that require large amounts of energy to compute and this energy usually comes from a power grid that is fed by fossil fuels. so one could say, if one runs a bitcoin node, they have a carbon footprint that is carbon positive compared to the offsets of digital money to paper money. this assertion is where one needs to reach further than just our present lives to understand the additionality of this statement. one could argue that paper money has been around since arguably 1776 upon the invention of USD when the federal reserve was invented by the founding fathers of the united states. paper money wasn't made the second columbus landed on plymoth but you get the point; usd was introduced about this time. that is a much longer time line than that of cryptocurrency when one fast forwards to the birth of digital currency and decentralization of banking via the blockchain. that began around 2009 when the data sphere began digital ledgers of the transactions the blockchain has honored. that is ~15 years of digital currency and ~250 years of paper money, specifically usd. now just a scaling argument can do a lot for our derivation given the timelines are a factor of 20 apart. that is to say 20 multiplied by 15 is ~300 which is very close to 200. so if you want a figure to scale with, a worst case calculation states that a bitcoin node costs ~$1/day to run. that would be $365/yr and that would be $5475/15yr for one node to operate. another worst case estimate of the cryptocurrency market is that about 50,000 nodes are currently active in the global blockchain. that would give us $275,000,000/15yrs to run the entire digital revolution of decentralization of banking and conventional capitalism. this is a gross oversimplification and errs on the calculations overstating the cost of the 15 years of crypto generation, processing, and maintence with respect to the energy needed to be produced on a fossil fuel power grid to power these events. "the digital decentralization revolution cost the world about 275 billion dollars usd in a additional cost to the global community". this spreads the conditions of the load to the globe to the entire population while the creation of usd as legal tender resulted from the original theft of land from the Comanche Native American tribes of North America. even if the same $1/day overhead loads of the usd market could be assumed that would result in a global cost of ~$5.5 trillion of cost to the globe and this figure would be spread out over the %1 of the population that hold %99 of the wealth in the capitalist framework. now in 1995, I was 10 years old and was able to use a computer. that is ~2 times as long as the crypto market has been around. the crypto market is only a portion of entire computing load of computers that use energy to do many different things. listen to music, watch tv, do taxes, write books. the energy consumed by their use is a balance between the additionality of what would have occured without computers being used for certain aspects of our lives. the amount of advanced made in medicine, for example, wouldn't be possible without, for one, the finance of successful business models like crypto, or the computing power of processing of human biometric data that helps doctors, scientists, and data analysts that use that data to make medical advances. it isn't as simple as slapping a dollar amount on a load and saying that one aspect of energy consumption is responsible for the amount of environmental change. without the funding the decentralization of banking has accomplished, some advaces would not have been as easily realized and with the same reductions in those same environmental changes. people are able to trade legal tender for resources without commuting to a bank, transferring funds, and finding a merchant to honor a promissory. the reduction in friction to free markets raises the overall offsets of the overall system. medical care is able to be procured on the street. goods and servises are freely advertised and traded via terminals that hyper simplify those trade agreements therefore reducing environmental degredation from every individuals combined draw on the system as a whole. nobody needs to jet set to travel the 50 states to sell baseball cards anymore. waste is reduced overall by a funneling of information to high priority nodes that focus information into the most factual accounts of the conditions of a derivation of free thought or capital gains. labor is now low impact. labor value used to be how many horsepower a capitalist could derive with a given investment of capital. now entire presidential campaigns depend on the shared energy pooling of information and advertising nodes to send a message of a candidate in a easily readable format that can be considered by multiple parties. basically, slave labor in the past was inhuman. now slave labor provides free porn to a bored and intelligent remote working class and snappy global derivations for the price of a tank of gas and it saves the tank of gas, and therefore the emissions related to it being burned. to equate bitcoin processing, maintenance, and generation to "the leading GHG emitter" is a gross oversimplification and it proves you didn't study mathematics, engineering, and mathematics in a peer reviewed scientific progressive environment.
